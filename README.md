# Probing Temporal Relations Between Pairs of Events.

This is the public repository for the paper ``How About Time? Probing a Multilingual Language Model for Temporal Relations'' (COLING 2022).

The probing experiments have been run using a multilingual language model (XLM-RoBERTa). All experiments focused on temporal relation classifiction between pairs of events (either in the same sentence or across different sentence) for different languages: English, Italian, Spanish, and French.
